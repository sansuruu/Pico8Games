# Pico 8 games
Collection of games I've made utilizing Pico-8

1) Procrasti-start
Made for Shovel Jam 2025, where the theme was "Just Get Started." The premise revolves around the choice of getting started with your homework or choosing to procrastinate. Roguelike game where items can help make the homework easier.
